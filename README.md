# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Franka!

I hold a degree in Languages, but my deep and long-standing passion for technology led me to shift my career path. Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science and I'm in my third year.

Despite not coming from a traditional tech background, I have always been curious about how systems work, how interfaces are designed, and how technology can improve people's lives. This curiosity pushed me to dive into programming, software development, and UX/UI design.

During my academic journey, I also had the opportunity to participate in an Erasmus exchange in Poland, which helped me develop adaptability, communication, and cross-cultural collaboration skills.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Learning
- Object-oriented programming (Python)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Databases (SQL)
- Version control (Git & GitHub)
- UI/UX principles and prototyping tools

## ðŸš€ My Goals
- Become a Salesforce Developer and contribute to impactful digital solutions
- Build real-world projects to strengthen my technical portfolio
- Work in a tech-driven environment that values learning, creativity, and collaboration

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
Iâ€™m currently working on small projects to improve my coding and problem-solving skills. Youâ€™ll soon find them here!
